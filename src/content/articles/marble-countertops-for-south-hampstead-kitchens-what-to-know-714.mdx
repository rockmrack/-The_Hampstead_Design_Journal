Whether you're a long-time resident or considering a move to South Hampstead, understanding its architectural heritage enriches your appreciation of this remarkable area.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in South Hampstead is Neo-Georgian, characterised by terracotta ornament. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature stucco over brick, with carved stone capitals providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original casement windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of South Hampstead owes much to its hipped roofs, with grouped flues punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by original cast iron railings, many original to the properties.

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in South Hampstead brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in South Hampstead's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of South Hampstead falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience
