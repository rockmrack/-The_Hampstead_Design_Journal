From the moment you pass beneath the canopy of mature London planes on New End, you sense you're somewhere special. This guide helps you understand why.

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Highgate brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Highgate's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Highgate falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience
