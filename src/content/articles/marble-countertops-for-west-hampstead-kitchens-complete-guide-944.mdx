Conservation and contemporary living meet in West Hampstead, where period properties continue to evolve while respecting their heritage. This balance is at the heart of successful ownership here.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in West Hampstead is Edwardian Baroque, characterised by half-timbering. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature stone dressings with brick, with dentil cornices providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original six-over-six sash windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of West Hampstead owes much to its mansard roofs, with ornate brick chimney stacks punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by York stone walls, many original to the properties.

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in West Hampstead involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods
