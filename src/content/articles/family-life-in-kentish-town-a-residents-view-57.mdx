The enduring appeal of Kentish Town lies not just in its location, but in the quality and character of its buildings. Let's examine what distinguishes them.

## The Market Today

Property in Kentish Town commands a premium reflecting its exceptional character and limited supply. Understanding the market helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

### Price Factors

**Location within location:** Even within Kentish Town, significant price variations exist. Properties on Keats Grove command the highest prices, while the streets off Haverstock Hill offer relative value.

**Condition:** The cost of sympathetic renovation means turnkey properties command substantial premiums over those requiring work.

**Period and style:** Georgian properties typically achieve the highest prices per square foot, followed by early Victorian, with later Victorian and Edwardian competing closely.

**Original features:** Properties retaining shutters, fireplaces, cornicing, and other period details outperform stripped-out alternatives.

### Current Trends

- Strong demand for family houses
- Premium for gardens and outdoor space
- Growing interest in flats within converted houses
- Continued preference for period over modern
- Increasing recognition of post-war architecture

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Kentish Town brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Kentish Town's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Kentish Town falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience

## Final Thoughts

Owning property in Kentish Town is a privilege that carries responsibility. These buildings have survived for over a century; our task is to ensure they survive for another.

The key is understanding before acting. Every property has a story, and successful ownership means becoming part of that narrative—contributing sympathetically rather than erasing what came before.

For those considering purchase, take time to understand what you're buying. For current owners, invest in proper maintenance and appropriate improvements. And for all of us, appreciate the remarkable legacy we've inherited in these streets.
