Discerning homeowners have long recognised Kentish Town as one of London's most desirable addresses. Here we examine the elements that define its unique character.

## What Defines the Architecture

The buildings of Kentish Town share certain characteristics while maintaining individual identity. This balance between coherence and variety is central to the area's appeal.

### Scale and Proportion

Unlike the grand terraces of Kensington or the cramped courts of inner London, Kentish Town's housing strikes a middle ground—substantial enough to impress, modest enough to feel domestic. Ceiling heights of 3.2 metres in reception rooms, generous windows, and well-proportioned rooms create comfortable family homes.

### Materials

The predominant material is London stock brick, used with Bath stone dressings for decorative effect. This palette creates visual harmony while allowing individual expression through details like door colours, ironwork patterns, and planting choices.

### Craftsmanship

Look closely at any period property in Kentish Town and you'll see evidence of skilled craftsmanship: the precision of brickwork, the flowing lines of joinery, the intricate patterns of decorative plasterwork. These details are irreplaceable and define the character of the buildings.

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Kentish Town brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Kentish Town's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Kentish Town falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience
