From the moment you pass beneath the canopy of mature London planes on Perrin's Lane, you sense you're somewhere special. This guide helps you understand why.

## Historical Context

The development of Highgate began in earnest during the Edwardian period, when the combination of clean air, elevated position, and proximity to London made it attractive to the prosperous middle classes.

The 1930s saw rapid expansion, with speculative builders creating the terraces and villas that define the area today. Unlike the grand aristocratic developments of Mayfair or Belgravia, Highgate attracted artists, writers, intellectuals, and professionals—giving it a distinctive bohemian character that persists today.

The arrival of the Underground in 1939 transformed Highgate from a semi-rural retreat into a commuter suburb, though one that maintained its village atmosphere and fiercely independent character.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Highgate is Neo-Georgian, characterised by decorative brickwork. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature painted brick, with terracotta panels providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original margin-light sashes remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Highgate owes much to its Welsh slate roofs, with decorative pots punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by low brick walls with railings, many original to the properties.

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in Highgate involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods

## Final Thoughts

Owning property in Highgate is a privilege that carries responsibility. These buildings have survived for over a century; our task is to ensure they survive for another.

The key is understanding before acting. Every property has a story, and successful ownership means becoming part of that narrative—contributing sympathetically rather than erasing what came before.

For those considering purchase, take time to understand what you're buying. For current owners, invest in proper maintenance and appropriate improvements. And for all of us, appreciate the remarkable legacy we've inherited in these streets.
