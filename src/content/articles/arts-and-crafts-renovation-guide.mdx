The stretch of residential streets running from Redington Road through to Frognal represents one of London's finest collections of Arts & Crafts domestic architecture. Built primarily between 1880 and 1910, these homes were conceived not as speculative developments, but as carefully crafted family residences by architects who believed in the unity of design, materials, and craftsmanship.

Today, these properties command premium prices—but only when they retain their architectural integrity. The difference between a sensitively restored Arts & Crafts home and one that has been "improved" with inappropriate materials can amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds in value. More importantly, it represents the difference between preservation and destruction of architectural heritage.

## Understanding the Architecture

The Arts & Crafts movement emerged as a reaction against Victorian mass production and poor-quality industrial materials. In Hampstead, architects like C.F.A. Voysey, M.H. Baillie Scott, and local firms created homes that expressed honesty in construction, quality in materials, and integration with their wooded, hillside setting.

### Key Architectural Features

**The Brickwork:** The red bricks used in these homes were hand-made, often from local London clay, and laid with lime mortar rather than cement. The texture varies subtly from brick to brick—a characteristic lost in modern machine-made alternatives. The pointing (the visible mortar joints) was typically executed in a flush or slightly recessed style, never the raised "ribbon pointing" that modern builders often apply.

**Timber Detailing:** External timber work—barge boards, brackets, and casement window frames—was invariably constructed from slow-grown oak or deal (pine), often left unpainted to weather naturally to a silver-grey. Where paint was applied, it was traditional oil-based paint in muted greens, whites, or earth tones, never modern gloss finishes.

**Clay Tile Roofing:** The steeply pitched roofs were covered in handmade clay tiles from manufacturers like Broseley or local tileries. These tiles were thicker and more irregular than modern alternatives, creating the characteristically textured roofline that modern concrete tiles completely fail to replicate.

**Chimneys:** Tall, prominent chimneys with decorative brickwork or terracotta chimney pots were both functional and aesthetic statements. Many have been reduced in height or removed entirely—a modification that fundamentally alters the building's proportions.

## The Problem: Well-Intentioned Destruction

Over the decades, many of these homes have been subjected to "improvements" that have actively damaged their value and character:

**Modern Cement Mortars:** The single most damaging intervention is repointing with hard cement mortar. Arts & Crafts buildings were designed to "breathe"—moisture moves through lime mortar, allowing the building to dry naturally. Cement mortar traps moisture, leading to brick deterioration (spalling), internal damp, and structural movement. Removing cement pointing and replacing it with appropriate lime mortar is now one of the most common—and expensive—remediation tasks in Hampstead renovation.

**uPVC Windows:** The replacement of original timber casements or sash windows with uPVC is perhaps the most visible act of architectural vandalism. Not only do these modern windows fail to replicate the slim sightlines and detailing of the originals, but Camden Council's conservation policies now require their removal in many cases. Homeowners who installed uPVC windows twenty years ago are now forced to replace them again with timber replicas—a double expense that could have been avoided.

**Inappropriate Render:** Many owners have applied modern cement-based renders over the original brickwork, ostensibly for weatherproofing. This traps moisture and causes the same issues as cement pointing. Where render is appropriate (some Arts & Crafts homes used lime render as part of the original design), it must be lime-based and applied by specialists.

**Vinyl and Asphalt Roofing:** The replacement of clay tiles with modern alternatives destroys the texture and colour variation that defines these rooflines. While clay tiles are more expensive initially, they last 100+ years, whereas cheaper alternatives require replacement every 20-30 years.

## The Solution: Specialist Restoration

Restoring an Arts & Crafts home requires both technical knowledge and access to appropriate materials. This is not work for a general builder.

### Brick Cleaning and Repointing

The first step in any restoration is often the careful cleaning of brickwork that has been obscured by decades of paint, cement, or urban pollution. This must be done using the DOFF or TORC systems—gentle steam or water-based cleaning that doesn't damage the brick surface. Abrasive cleaning methods (sandblasting or harsh chemical washes) irreversibly damage the fired outer surface of the brick.

Repointing must be executed using NHL (Natural Hydraulic Lime) mortar, typically NHL 3.5 for exposed elevations. The mortar mix must be weaker than the brick, allowing any moisture or structural movement to be accommodated by the mortar joints rather than cracking the bricks themselves. The colour of the mortar should match the original—usually a pale buff or cream, achieved by using the appropriate sand aggregate.

### Sash Window Repair

Original sash windows can almost always be repaired rather than replaced. The typical issues—broken sash cords, deteriorated lower sills, loose joints—are straightforward for a joiner who specializes in historic windows. Where replacement is unavoidable, new windows must be manufactured using slow-grown timber with the same sectional profiles as the originals. Slim double-glazing (typically 14mm units) can be accommodated within traditional sections, providing modern thermal performance without compromising aesthetics.

For listed buildings or properties in conservation areas, any window replacement requires planning consent. Camden Council will reject applications that propose uPVC or modern timber windows with inappropriate glazing bars or proportions.

### Roofing

Clay tile roofs can be maintained indefinitely through careful re-bedding and the replacement of individual cracked tiles. When complete re-roofing is necessary, reclaimed tiles from the same era provide the best match. Several specialist suppliers in the UK stock salvaged tiles from demolished Arts & Crafts buildings. New handmade clay tiles from manufacturers like Imerys are also acceptable but lack the patina of aged tiles.

The underlying roof structure—typically timber rafters and battens—should be inspected by a structural engineer. Many roofs have been partially rebuilt using modern materials; returning to traditional breathable construction (with lime mortar bedding rather than cement) is essential for long-term performance.

### Decorative Timber

External timber work is best maintained through regular application of linseed oil or traditional oil-based paint systems. Modern microporous paints are marketed as "breathable," but they fail on historic timber because they cannot accommodate the movement of large-section timbers through seasonal moisture changes. Traditional oil paints remain flexible and can be repaired indefinitely without stripping back to bare wood.

## Planning and Listed Building Considerations

Many Arts & Crafts homes in Hampstead are Grade II listed or located within conservation areas. This designation brings both restrictions and benefits:

**Restrictions:** Any external alterations, including window replacement, roof repairs, or extensions, require Listed Building Consent or Conservation Area Consent from Camden Council. The Council's conservation officers assess applications against the principle of "like-for-like" replacement and will reject proposals that use modern materials or alter historic details.

**Benefits:** VAT relief is available on approved alterations to listed buildings, reducing the cost of restoration work by 20%. Additionally, grants may be available from Historic England or local preservation trusts for particularly significant buildings.

### Working with Conservation Officers

The key to a successful planning application is early engagement with Camden's conservation team. Submit pre-application advice requests with detailed photographs, material samples, and drawings. Demonstrate understanding of the building's significance and propose solutions that enhance rather than compromise its character.

## The Economic Case

The cost of proper restoration is higher than standard renovation—but the value premium is substantial. In 2024, a fully restored Arts & Crafts home on Redington Road sold for £1,850 per square foot, while a comparable property with uPVC windows and cement repointing achieved only £1,350 per square foot. That differential amounts to £500,000 on a 3,000 sq ft house.

Moreover, proper restoration is a long-term investment. Lime mortar and traditional materials require less frequent maintenance than modern replacements. The lifetime cost of maintaining traditional timber sash windows is lower than the cost of replacing uPVC windows every 25 years.

## Selecting the Right Team

Restoring an Arts & Crafts home requires a contractor with specific experience in heritage work. Look for:

- **Membership in conservation trade bodies:** The Guild of Master Craftsmen, the Stone Federation, or SPAB (Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings) membership indicates specialist training.
- **Portfolio of listed building work:** Ask to see photographs and references from previous heritage projects, preferably in Hampstead or similar conservation areas.
- **Understanding of materials:** The contractor should be able to discuss lime mortar mixes, timber species, and traditional joinery techniques without reference to modern alternatives.
- **Relationships with Camden Council:** Experienced heritage contractors maintain positive working relationships with conservation officers and can facilitate the planning process.

## Maintaining the Result

Once restored, an Arts & Crafts home requires knowledgeable maintenance:

- **Annual roof inspection:** Check for displaced tiles, blocked gutters (especially under the plane trees common in Hampstead), and deterioration of leadwork.
- **Timber maintenance:** External timber should be inspected every 2-3 years and repainted as needed. Early attention to minor issues prevents expensive repairs.
- **Gutter and drainage:** The steeply pitched roofs and prominent guttering typical of these homes require regular cleaning. Blocked hoppers or downpipes cause overflow that damages brickwork.
- **Interior decoration:** Original internal joinery, plasterwork, and fireplaces should be retained. Where modern fixtures have been installed (fitted kitchens, bathrooms), aim for designs that respect the building's character—avoid overly contemporary styles that jar with the architecture.

## Conclusion

The Arts & Crafts homes of Hampstead are irreplaceable. Each represents a moment in architectural history when craftsmanship, materials, and design were united in the creation of beautiful, functional domestic spaces. Restoring these buildings properly is both a technical challenge and a cultural responsibility.

The reward—beyond the substantial financial value—is the pleasure of living in a home that has been sensitively returned to its original conception. When lime mortar allows the walls to breathe, when timber casements swing smoothly on their original hinges, and when the afternoon sun illuminates hand-made brickwork in the way the architect intended, you inhabit not just a house, but a piece of living history.

Restoring these facades requires a specialist understanding of lime mortar, traditional brick cleaning techniques, and the patience to execute repairs that will last another century. It is work that cannot be rushed, and it is not work for those who see buildings as mere commodities. But for those who understand what they own, proper restoration is the only acceptable path forward.
