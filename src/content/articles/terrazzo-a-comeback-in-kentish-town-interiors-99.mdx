The property market in Kentish Town reflects its exceptional character. Here, we look beyond the price tags to understand what makes these homes so special.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Kentish Town is Gothic Revival, characterised by Dutch gables. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature red brick, with dentil cornices providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original two-over-two sash windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Kentish Town owes much to its hipped roofs, with rendered chimney stacks punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by privet hedging, many original to the properties.

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in Kentish Town involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Kentish Town brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Kentish Town's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Kentish Town falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience

## Summary

The properties of Kentish Town represent some of the finest domestic architecture in Britain. Understanding their character, caring for their fabric, and adapting them sensitively for modern life ensures they'll continue to provide exceptional homes for generations to come.
