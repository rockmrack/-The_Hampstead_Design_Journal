Discerning homeowners have long recognised Hampstead Garden Suburb as one of London's most desirable addresses. Here we examine the elements that define its unique character.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Hampstead Garden Suburb is Georgian, characterised by decorative brickwork. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature painted brick, with decorative bargeboards providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original two-over-two sash windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Hampstead Garden Suburb owes much to its clay tile roofs, with ornate brick chimney stacks punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by low brick walls with railings, many original to the properties.

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Hampstead Garden Suburb brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Hampstead Garden Suburb's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Hampstead Garden Suburb falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience
