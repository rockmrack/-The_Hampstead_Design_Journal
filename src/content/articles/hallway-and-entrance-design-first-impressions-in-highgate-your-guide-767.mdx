The property market in Highgate reflects its exceptional character. Here, we look beyond the price tags to understand what makes these homes so special.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Highgate is Georgian, characterised by terracotta ornament. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature painted brick, with decorative bargeboards providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original bay windows with sashes remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Highgate owes much to its clay tile roofs, with rendered chimney stacks punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by original cast iron railings, many original to the properties.

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in Highgate involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods

## Summary

The properties of Highgate represent some of the finest domestic architecture in Britain. Understanding their character, caring for their fabric, and adapting them sensitively for modern life ensures they'll continue to provide exceptional homes for generations to come.
