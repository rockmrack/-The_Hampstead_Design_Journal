From the moment you pass beneath the canopy of mature London planes on Eton Avenue, you sense you're somewhere special. This guide helps you understand why.

## The Market Today

Property in West Hampstead commands a premium reflecting its exceptional character and limited supply. Understanding the market helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

### Price Factors

**Location within location:** Even within West Hampstead, significant price variations exist. Properties on Keats Grove command the highest prices, while the flats on Adelaide Road offer relative value.

**Condition:** The cost of sympathetic renovation means turnkey properties command substantial premiums over those requiring work.

**Period and style:** Georgian properties typically achieve the highest prices per square foot, followed by early Victorian, with later Victorian and Edwardian competing closely.

**Original features:** Properties retaining shutters, fireplaces, cornicing, and other period details outperform stripped-out alternatives.

### Current Trends

- Strong demand for family houses
- Premium for gardens and outdoor space
- Growing interest in flats within converted houses
- Continued preference for period over modern
- Increasing recognition of post-war architecture

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in West Hampstead involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods

## Final Thoughts

Owning property in West Hampstead is a privilege that carries responsibility. These buildings have survived for over a century; our task is to ensure they survive for another.

The key is understanding before acting. Every property has a story, and successful ownership means becoming part of that narrative—contributing sympathetically rather than erasing what came before.

For those considering purchase, take time to understand what you're buying. For current owners, invest in proper maintenance and appropriate improvements. And for all of us, appreciate the remarkable legacy we've inherited in these streets.
