Discerning homeowners have long recognised Highgate as one of London's most desirable addresses. Here we examine the elements that define its unique character.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Highgate is Arts and Crafts, characterised by terracotta ornament. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature stone dressings with brick, with ornate door surrounds providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original casement windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Highgate owes much to its Welsh slate roofs, with decorative pots punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by original cast iron railings, many original to the properties.

## Living in a Period Property

The reality of owning a period home in Highgate involves balancing preservation with contemporary life. Here's what to consider.

### Energy Efficiency

Historic buildings were designed to breathe—solid walls, lime mortars, and natural materials managing moisture through evaporation. Modern interventions must respect this:

- **Insulation:** Internal wall insulation requires careful specification to avoid condensation
- **Windows:** Secondary glazing often outperforms replacement double glazing while preserving character
- **Heating:** Underfloor heating works well with traditional solid floors; radiators suit suspended timber floors
- **Draught-proofing:** Simple measures make significant comfort improvements

### Modern Services

Integrating contemporary services requires sensitivity:

- **Electrical:** Rewiring should minimise damage to historic fabric
- **Plumbing:** Routes should avoid cutting through structural timbers
- **Technology:** Smart home systems can be installed invisibly
- **Lighting:** LED technology allows period-appropriate fittings with modern efficiency

### Insurance

Standard home insurance may not adequately cover period properties. Specialist providers understand:
- Rebuild costs for traditional construction
- Listed Building requirements
- Non-standard materials and methods

## Final Thoughts

Owning property in Highgate is a privilege that carries responsibility. These buildings have survived for over a century; our task is to ensure they survive for another.

The key is understanding before acting. Every property has a story, and successful ownership means becoming part of that narrative—contributing sympathetically rather than erasing what came before.

For those considering purchase, take time to understand what you're buying. For current owners, invest in proper maintenance and appropriate improvements. And for all of us, appreciate the remarkable legacy we've inherited in these streets.
