A planning refusal in Hampstead or Belsize Park is not necessarily the end of the road. The planning appeal system provides an independent review of council decisions, and a significant proportion of appeals succeed. However, appeals are expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain—understanding when and how to appeal is essential before committing.

This guide explains the appeal process for residential planning applications in Camden, drawing on precedent cases and practical experience to help homeowners make informed decisions.

## Understanding Your Refusal

### The Decision Notice

When Camden refuses planning permission, you receive a Decision Notice stating:
- The application reference number
- A description of the proposed development
- The reasons for refusal (numbered)
- Information about appeal rights

**The reasons for refusal are crucial.** Each reason represents a policy conflict or harm that Camden believes your proposal would cause. Your appeal must address each reason convincingly.

### Types of Refusal Reasons

**Policy-based reasons**: "The proposal is contrary to Policy H7 of the Camden Local Plan..."
These require demonstrating either that the policy doesn't apply, or that material considerations outweigh policy conflict.

**Harm-based reasons**: "The proposal would cause unacceptable harm to the character of the conservation area..."
These require evidence that the alleged harm doesn't exist, is overstated, or is outweighed by benefits.

**Technical reasons**: "The proposal fails to demonstrate adequate parking provision..."
These can sometimes be addressed by additional information submitted with the appeal.

**Cumulative reasons**: Multiple concerns that individually might be acceptable but together justify refusal.
These require addressing each concern while arguing that the combination doesn't justify refusal.

### Analysing Your Refusal

Before deciding whether to appeal, answer these questions:

1. **Is the refusal based on fundamental policy conflict?**
   - If your proposal exceeds 50% of garden area for a basement, policy conflict is clear and appeal is unlikely to succeed.

2. **Is the refusal based on design concerns that could be addressed?**
   - If the Inspector might approve an amended scheme, consider resubmission rather than appeal.

3. **Did the officer recommend approval but committee refused?**
   - Committee overturns (where officers recommended approval) have higher appeal success rates—the professional view supports your proposal.

4. **Were there significant objections from statutory consultees?**
   - Conservation Area Advisory Committee, Tree Officers, or Highways objections carry weight with Inspectors.

5. **Is the refusal consistent with similar decisions in the area?**
   - If similar schemes were approved nearby, you have precedent evidence.

## Appeal Options

### Written Representations

**The process**: You submit a written statement; Camden submits a response; the Inspector decides based on documents alone.

**Best for**:
- Straightforward cases with clear policy interpretation issues
- Where facts are not disputed
- Smaller-scale proposals (extensions, alterations)
- When speed is important (typically 12-16 weeks)

**Not suitable for**:
- Complex cases requiring oral examination
- Where credibility of evidence is contested
- Proposals with significant third-party interest

### Hearing

**The process**: An informal round-table discussion chaired by the Inspector. You, Camden, and interested parties discuss the issues.

**Best for**:
- Cases with policy interpretation questions
- Where dialogue might clarify issues
- Community-sensitive proposals where neighbours want to participate
- Medium-complexity cases

**Timeline**: Typically 16-24 weeks

### Public Inquiry

**The process**: Formal adversarial process with legal representation, cross-examination, and formal rules of evidence.

**Best for**:
- Major proposals with significant impacts
- Cases where expert evidence is contested
- Where legal arguments are central
- High-value or precedent-setting applications

**Timeline**: Often 6-12 months; can exceed 18 months for complex cases

**Cost**: Legal representation, expert witnesses, and preparation typically cost £20,000-£100,000+ depending on complexity.

### Householder Appeals

For minor householder applications (extensions, alterations), a streamlined process applies:
- Written representations only
- Shortened timeline (8-12 weeks typical)
- Simplified statement format

Most Hampstead residential appeals fall into this category.

## Preparing Your Appeal

### Gathering Evidence

**Planning history**: What has been approved on your property and neighbours? Use Camden's planning portal to research comparable applications.

**Site photographs**: Document existing conditions, context, relationships to neighbours, street scene character.

**Professional reports**: If refusing on technical grounds (trees, structures, highways), commission independent professional assessments.

**Precedent decisions**: Find appeal decisions in similar cases—successful appeals for comparable development strengthen your case.

### Writing Your Statement

**Structure for written representations**:

1. **Introduction**: The site, the proposal, the refusal reasons
2. **Site description**: Location, character, planning history
3. **The proposal**: What you're seeking to build (briefly—the Inspector has your drawings)
4. **Response to refusal reasons**: Address each reason systematically
5. **Planning policy analysis**: How the proposal complies with relevant policies
6. **Material considerations**: Why any policy conflict is outweighed
7. **Precedent**: Comparable approved schemes or successful appeals
8. **Conclusion**: Why the appeal should be allowed

**Tone**: Factual and respectful. Personal criticism of the council or officer rarely helps.

**Length**: For householder appeals, 10-20 pages is typical. Major appeals may run to hundreds of pages with appendices.

### Common Arguments

**Design quality**: "The proposal is of high design quality appropriate to its context..."
Support with: architect's design statement, CGI visualisations, analysis of local character.

**Limited harm**: "The alleged harm to the conservation area is minimal and localised..."
Support with: verified views analysis, comparison with existing conditions, assessment of significance.

**Benefits outweigh harm**: "The public benefits of the proposal outweigh any limited harm..."
Support with: housing delivery, economic benefits, heritage restoration, sustainability improvements.

**Policy misapplication**: "The Council has misinterpreted Policy X, which properly understood supports this proposal..."
Support with: policy wording analysis, supporting text, comparable decisions.

**Changed circumstances**: "Since determination, [X] has changed, which affects the planning balance..."
Support with: new policy documents, court judgments, appeal decisions.

## What Happens During the Appeal

### Written Representations Timeline

1. **Week 0**: Appeal submitted to Planning Inspectorate (PINS)
2. **Week 1-2**: PINS validates appeal and notifies Camden
3. **Week 3-6**: Camden prepares response (questionnaire and statement)
4. **Week 6-8**: Appellant can respond to council's statement
5. **Week 8-10**: Site visit (usually unaccompanied unless access issues)
6. **Week 10-16**: Inspector prepares decision
7. **Decision issued**: Written decision with full reasoning

### Site Visits

The Inspector will visit the site to:
- Verify factual matters (what can be seen from where)
- Assess impacts (overlooking, overshadowing, visual intrusion)
- Understand context (street character, neighbour relationships)

**Accompanied visits**: You and the council attend; you can point out features but not make submissions.

**Unaccompanied visits**: Inspector views from public areas only; useful if access issues exist.

For most householder appeals, unaccompanied visits are standard. Request accompanied visit if internal viewing is essential or if access points are restricted.

### Hearing Procedure

If you've requested a hearing:

1. **Pre-hearing**: Exchange statements and identify key issues
2. **Opening**: Inspector explains procedure and identifies discussion topics
3. **Discussion**: Round-table discussion of each issue in turn
4. **Site visit**: Usually immediately after hearing
5. **Close**: No formal closing submissions; Inspector summarises understanding

Hearings typically last half a day to one day. You can represent yourself or use a planning consultant.

### The Inspector's Decision

The decision letter typically includes:

- Summary of the proposal and site
- Main issues identified
- Assessment of each main issue
- Planning balance
- Overall conclusion
- Formal decision (allowed/dismissed)
- Any conditions (if allowed)

**If allowed**: Permission is granted by the Inspector. The council cannot challenge except through High Court judicial review (rare, expensive, and limited to legal errors).

**If dismissed**: You can:
- Accept the outcome
- Resubmit a revised scheme to the council
- In exceptional cases, challenge by judicial review (must demonstrate legal error, not merely disagree with judgment)

## Appeal Success Factors

### Factors Favouring Success

**Officer recommendation to approve**: Indicates professional support; committee override increases appeal prospects.

**Single refusal reason**: Easier to address than multiple concerns.

**Design-based refusal with strong professional evidence**: Inspectors are experienced in design assessment and may disagree with council judgments.

**Clear precedent**: Approved comparable schemes or allowed appeals on similar sites.

**Policy transitioning**: If new policy is more favourable and was adopted after determination.

### Factors Against Success

**Multiple refusal reasons**: Requires defeating all reasons; losing on any typically means dismissal.

**Statutory consultee objections**: Conservation Officers, Tree Officers, Highways—their views carry weight.

**Community opposition**: While not determinative, significant local objection (especially organised) influences Inspectors.

**Policy breach**: If proposal clearly conflicts with up-to-date policy, persuading Inspector of material considerations is harder.

**Poor design**: Inspectors dismiss proposals they consider poorly designed, regardless of policy arguments.

## Case Studies from NW3

### Case 1: Rear Extension Appeal Allowed

**Situation**: Single-storey rear extension refused due to "excessive rearward projection harming neighbours' amenity."

**Appeal argument**: Applicant demonstrated:
- No overshadowing (sun path analysis)
- No overlooking (no new windows to affected boundary)
- Precedent of similar extensions on the terrace
- Officer had recommended approval

**Outcome**: Appeal allowed. Inspector found alleged harm overstated; precedent demonstrated acceptability.

**Lesson**: Technical evidence (sun studies) and precedent can overcome design judgment refusals.

### Case 2: Loft Conversion Appeal Dismissed

**Situation**: Rear dormer refused for "harmful impact on conservation area roofscape."

**Appeal argument**: Applicant argued:
- Rear dormers exist elsewhere on the street
- Dormer would not be visible from principal public viewpoints
- Design was traditional and sympathetic

**Outcome**: Dismissed. Inspector found:
- Existing dormers predated conservation area designation (not precedent)
- Some visibility from rear gardens and upper floors of facing properties
- Cumulative impact of further dormers would be harmful

**Lesson**: "Visibility" in conservation areas isn't limited to public views; Inspector took stricter view than applicant hoped.

### Case 3: Basement Appeal Dismissed

**Situation**: Basement exceeding 50% of garden refused under Camden's Basement Policy.

**Appeal argument**: Applicant argued:
- Special circumstances (large family, specific needs)
- Basement would be invisible
- Tree protection measures adequate

**Outcome**: Dismissed. Inspector found:
- Personal circumstances are not material planning considerations
- Policy limit of 50% reflects considered balance
- No basis to depart from up-to-date policy

**Lesson**: Challenging clear policy limits requires exceptional circumstances; personal need rarely suffices.

## Costs and Timescales

### Typical Costs

**Householder appeal (written representations)**:
- DIY: Minimal (your time)
- Planning consultant: £2,000-£5,000
- With supporting reports (arboriculture, heritage): Add £1,000-£3,000

**Hearing**:
- Planning consultant representation: £5,000-£15,000
- Expert witnesses (if needed): £2,000-£5,000 each
- Total typical range: £8,000-£25,000

**Public Inquiry**:
- Legal representation: £15,000-£50,000+
- Expert witnesses: £5,000-£15,000 each
- Inquiry preparation and attendance: £10,000-£30,000
- Total typical range: £40,000-£150,000+

### Costs Awards

**Who pays**: Generally, each party bears their own costs.

**Awards against council**: Only if council behaved unreasonably (procedural failures, ignoring clear policy, refusing to negotiate). Rare.

**Awards against appellant**: If appeal is frivolous or procedurally abusive. Very rare for genuine appeals.

In practice, assume you will bear your own costs regardless of outcome.

### Timescales

**Written representations**: 12-16 weeks (householder: 8-12 weeks)
**Hearing**: 16-24 weeks
**Public Inquiry**: 6-18 months

PINS publishes average timescales; currently experiencing delays, so add 20-30% to historic averages.

## When Not to Appeal

Consider not appealing if:

1. **Proposal clearly breaches policy**: Inspectors don't override clear policy without compelling reasons.

2. **Design has fundamental problems**: Better to redesign and resubmit than defend a weak scheme.

3. **Resubmission might succeed**: A revised scheme addressing concerns may be approved without appeal.

4. **Time is critical**: Appeals take months; resubmission may be faster.

5. **Relationship with council matters**: If you'll need future permissions, maintaining goodwill has value.

6. **Costs outweigh benefits**: For minor works, appeal costs may exceed the value of the permission.

## Conclusion

The planning appeal system provides genuine independent review—Inspectors regularly disagree with council decisions, and approximately 30% of appeals nationally succeed. However, success requires understanding your case's strengths and weaknesses, marshalling evidence effectively, and presenting arguments clearly.

For Hampstead and Belsize Park homeowners, the most common scenarios involve design judgment (rear extensions, dormers) where professional evidence and precedent can make the difference. Challenging clear policy limits (basement size, conservation area restrictions) is harder but not impossible where genuinely exceptional circumstances exist.

Before appealing, honestly assess your prospects. Speak to a planning consultant who can review your case objectively. If the assessment is positive, commit to the process and prepare thoroughly. The time and expense of a well-prepared appeal is worthwhile if success is reasonably achievable.

If prospects are poor, a strategic resubmission—addressing concerns while preserving your objectives—may achieve more than a dismissed appeal. The right approach depends on your specific circumstances, your priorities, and your tolerance for uncertainty.

Whatever you decide, understand that a planning refusal is a professional judgment that can be tested, not a final verdict. The appeal system exists precisely because councils sometimes get decisions wrong. Using it effectively is your right as an applicant.
