The enduring appeal of Kentish Town lies not just in its location, but in the quality and character of its buildings. Let's examine what distinguishes them.

## Historical Context

The development of Kentish Town began in earnest during the Georgian period, when the combination of clean air, elevated position, and proximity to London made it attractive to the prosperous middle classes.

The 1820s saw rapid expansion, with speculative builders creating the terraces and villas that define the area today. Unlike the grand aristocratic developments of Mayfair or Belgravia, Kentish Town attracted artists, writers, intellectuals, and professionals—giving it a distinctive bohemian character that persists today.

The arrival of the Underground in 1907 transformed Kentish Town from a semi-rural retreat into a commuter suburb, though one that maintained its village atmosphere and fiercely independent character.

## Architectural Character

The prevailing architectural style in Kentish Town is Neo-Georgian, characterised by terracotta ornament. However, the area's appeal lies in its variety—a walk down any street reveals subtle differences in detail, proportion, and decoration.

### Key Features

**Facades:** Most properties feature painted brick, with terracotta panels providing visual interest. The craftsmanship evident in these details reflects the skilled workforce available during the building period.

**Windows:** Original six-over-six sash windows remain in many properties, though sympathetic replacements using traditional methods are common. The glazing bars, horns, and ironmongery all contribute to the character.

**Rooflines:** The distinctive skyline of Kentish Town owes much to its mansard roofs, with rendered chimney stacks punctuating the roofscape.

**Boundaries:** Front gardens are typically bounded by York stone walls, many original to the properties.

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Kentish Town brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Kentish Town's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Kentish Town falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience

## Final Thoughts

Owning property in Kentish Town is a privilege that carries responsibility. These buildings have survived for over a century; our task is to ensure they survive for another.

The key is understanding before acting. Every property has a story, and successful ownership means becoming part of that narrative—contributing sympathetically rather than erasing what came before.

For those considering purchase, take time to understand what you're buying. For current owners, invest in proper maintenance and appropriate improvements. And for all of us, appreciate the remarkable legacy we've inherited in these streets.
