From the moment you pass beneath the canopy of mature London planes on Cannon Lane, you sense you're somewhere special. This guide helps you understand why.

## The Market Today

Property in Highgate commands a premium reflecting its exceptional character and limited supply. Understanding the market helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

### Price Factors

**Location within location:** Even within Highgate, significant price variations exist. Properties on Keats Grove command the highest prices, while the streets off Haverstock Hill offer relative value.

**Condition:** The cost of sympathetic renovation means turnkey properties command substantial premiums over those requiring work.

**Period and style:** Georgian properties typically achieve the highest prices per square foot, followed by early Victorian, with later Victorian and Edwardian competing closely.

**Original features:** Properties retaining shutters, fireplaces, cornicing, and other period details outperform stripped-out alternatives.

### Current Trends

- Strong demand for family houses
- Premium for gardens and outdoor space
- Growing interest in flats within converted houses
- Continued preference for period over modern
- Increasing recognition of post-war architecture

## Practical Considerations

Owning a period property in Highgate brings responsibilities alongside privileges. Understanding these helps ensure successful stewardship.

### Maintenance

The traditional materials used in Highgate's buildings—lime mortars, timber windows, lead flashings—require specific maintenance approaches. Modern substitutes often cause more problems than they solve.

**Annual checks should include:**
- Roof condition and flashings
- Gutters and downpipes
- Pointing and render
- Window condition
- Timber decay inspection

### Consents and Permissions

Most of Highgate falls within a Conservation Area, meaning external alterations require planning permission. Many properties are also Listed, adding further requirements. Before any work, establish:

1. Conservation Area status
2. Listed Building status
3. Article 4 directions
4. Tree Preservation Orders

### Finding the Right Professionals

Period property work requires specialists who understand traditional construction. Look for:
- RIBA Conservation Architects
- IHBC members for conservation advice
- Guild of Master Craftsmen for building work
- RICS chartered surveyors with heritage experience

## Summary

The properties of Highgate represent some of the finest domestic architecture in Britain. Understanding their character, caring for their fabric, and adapting them sensitively for modern life ensures they'll continue to provide exceptional homes for generations to come.

For specific advice on your property, consult qualified professionals with heritage experience. For community matters, engage with local conservation and residents' groups.
