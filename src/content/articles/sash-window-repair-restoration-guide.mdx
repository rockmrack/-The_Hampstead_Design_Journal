The single greatest architectural loss in Britain's historic housing stock is original windows. For every Georgian sash that survives, ten have been replacedâ€”often with uPVC units that destroy the building's character, frequently with "heritage-style" timber windows that lack the craftsmanship of originals.

This destruction continues despite clear evidence that original windows can be repaired, upgraded, and made to perform as well as or better than replacementsâ€”at lower cost and with authentic results.

This guide explains why restoration should be your first choice, how to assess your windows, and what restoration options exist.

## Why Original Windows Matter

### Architectural Significance

Georgian and Victorian sash windows are not merely functional elements but defining architectural features:

**Proportions**: The ratio of glazing bars to glass, frame to opening, upper to lower sashâ€”these create the visual rhythm of historic facades. Modern replacements invariably alter these proportions (thicker frames, fewer glazing bars, different sash weights).

**Glass**: Original crown glass (Georgian) or cylinder glass (Victorian) has optical qualities impossible to replicate. The subtle distortions, thickness variations, and surface textures create the living quality of historic buildings.

**Craftsmanship**: Traditional joinery techniques (mortice-and-tenon joints, hand-fitted sash weights, brass fittings) represent skills now rare. Replacements use modern manufacturing shortcuts invisible from a distance but obvious close-up.

**Patina**: The accumulation of paint layers, wear patterns, and repairs tells the building's history. Replacements start the story over.

### Conservation Policy

Planning authorities and conservation officers strongly favour retention:

**Listed buildings**: Replacement windows almost certainly require Listed Building Consent. Consent is unlikely unless originals are beyond repairâ€”a high bar when repair is almost always possible.

**Conservation areas**: While not automatic protection, there is strong presumption against replacement. Camden's planning guidance explicitly prefers repair and upgrade to replacement.

**Article 4 Directions**: Many conservation areas (including much of Hampstead) have Article 4 Directions removing permitted development rights for window replacement. Any change requires planning permission.

### Practical Performance

Counter-intuitively, restored original windows often outperform replacements:

**Longevity**: Original windows have already lasted 100-200 years. With maintenance, they will last another 100+. Replacements (even good quality timber) typically last 25-50 years before requiring further replacement.

**Repairability**: Damage to originals can be repaired locallyâ€”a broken pane, a rotten section, worn draught seals. Damage to replacements often requires replacing whole units.

**Sustainability**: Restoring existing windows has a fraction of the carbon footprint of manufacturing and installing new ones. The greenest window is the one you already have.

**Cost**: Comprehensive restoration including draught-proofing and slim double glazing typically costs 30-50% less than quality replacement windows.

## Assessing Your Windows

### What to Look For

Survey each window systematically:

**Frame condition**:
- Is the frame (the fixed outer part) solid or rotten?
- Are joints tight or separated?
- Is the sill intact or decayed?

**Sash condition**:
- Do sashes slide freely?
- Are rails and stiles (horizontal and vertical members) solid?
- Are glazing bars intact?

**Glass**:
- Is original glass present (look for imperfections)?
- Are there cracks or broken panes?

**Hardware**:
- Are sash cords intact?
- Do catches and locks function?
- Are pulleys and weights present?

**Draught**:
- Does cold air enter around sashes?
- Do sashes rattle in the wind?

### Common Problems and Solutions

| Problem | Severity | Solution |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Paint failure | Low | Strip and repaint |
| Rattling sashes | Low | Draught-proofing |
| Broken cords | Low | Replace cords |
| Broken glass | Low | Reglaze |
| Stiff operation | Medium | Overhaul and lubricate |
| Rotten sections | Medium | Splice repairs |
| Missing glazing bars | Medium | Replace/reinstate |
| Extensive rot | High | Part replacement of components |
| Structural frame failure | High | Specialist repair |

Only the most severe deteriorationâ€”frame failure, complete sash disintegrationâ€”justifies replacement. Everything else is repairable.

### When Replacement Might Be Justified

Genuine cases for replacement (not just preference):

1. **Non-original windows already**: If previous owners installed poor replacements, further replacement with authentic designs may improve the building
2. **Fire damage**: Complete destruction beyond repair
3. **Structural failure**: Frame has separated from wall or lost structural integrity
4. **Original design was inappropriate**: Rare cases where windows were historically poorly designed

Even these cases should be approached carefullyâ€”repair is almost always possible, if expensive.

## Restoration Options

### Level 1: Maintenance and Draught-Proofing

**Scope**: Overhaul and draught-proof otherwise sound windows.

**Works**:
- Remove sashes (they lift out when staff beads are removed)
- Strip and sand (by hand or infrared paint removalâ€”no blowtorches near glass)
- Repair minor damage (fill small cracks, reglaze loose putty)
- Install draught-proofing (brush pile or rubber gasket in grooves)
- Rehang and balance sashes
- Repaint in appropriate system (oil-based or water-based primer/undercoat/gloss)

**Results**:
- Eliminates draughts (draught-proofing reduces air infiltration by 80%+)
- Improves operation (sashes slide smoothly)
- Extends paint life (no moisture penetration)
- Preserves all original fabric

**Cost**: Â£400-Â£800 per window depending on size and condition.

**DIY potential**: Moderateâ€”draught-proofing kits available for competent DIYers. Painting requires care around original glass.

### Level 2: Restoration with Timber Repairs

**Scope**: Address decay while retaining maximum original material.

**Works**:
All Level 1 works, plus:
- Splice repairs to rotted sections (matching timber spliced in; original remaining)
- Resin consolidation of soft timber
- Replacement of beyond-repair components (individual rails or stiles) while retaining others
- Reinstatement of missing glazing bars

**Results**:
- Fully functional windows with extended lifespan
- Original material retained wherever possible
- Character preserved through minimum intervention

**Cost**: Â£600-Â£1,500 per window depending on extent of repairs.

**DIY potential**: Limitedâ€”timber splicing requires joinery skills. Professional restoration recommended.

### Level 3: Thermal Upgrade with Slim Double Glazing

**Scope**: Improve thermal performance while retaining original sashes.

**Options**:

**Vacuum glazing (e.g., Pilkington Spacia)**: Ultra-thin (6.2mm) vacuum-sealed units can replace single glass in original rebates. No modification to glazing bars required.
- U-value: 1.1-1.4 W/mÂ²K (versus 5.8 for single glazing)
- Cost: Â£300-Â£500 per sqm glass area

**Slim sealed units (e.g., Histoglass)**: Thin sealed double glazing (typically 11-14mm) requires slightly wider rebates.
- U-value: 1.8-2.0 W/mÂ²K
- Cost: Â£150-Â£300 per sqm glass area

**Secondary glazing**: Separate glazed panels fitted internally. No modification to originals.
- U-value: 2.0-2.5 W/mÂ²K (whole window including primary)
- Cost: Â£200-Â£500 per window
- Advantage: Completely reversible; excellent acoustic performance

**Results**:
- Thermal performance approaching modern windows
- Original appearance preserved (especially vacuum glazing)
- Reduced energy bills and improved comfort
- Compliance with energy efficiency aspirations without replacement

**Cost**: Varies significantly by option. A full restoration with vacuum glazing: Â£1,200-Â£2,500 per window.

**Listed building considerations**: Vacuum glazing generally acceptable (no visible change). Slim units may require consent if rebate modification proposed. Secondary glazing usually acceptable (reversible).

## Specialist Contractors

### National Specialists

**Ventrolla**: The largest specialist sash window restoration company. Branches nationwide including London. Known for their "Ventrolla perimeter sealing system."

**The Sash Window Workshop**: High-quality restoration focusing on traditional techniques. London-based with national coverage for significant projects.

**Mumford & Wood**: Premium joinery manufacturer. Not restoration specialists but offer exceptional quality new windows where replacement is justified.

**Fulham Timber Windows**: South London specialist with conservation area experience.

**Wandsworth Sash Windows**: Extensive work in period properties across South and West London.

**Heritage Window Repairs**: North London specialist with strong Hampstead track record.

### Finding the Right Contractor

Questions to ask:

1. **Do you repair or replace?** Beware contractors who default to replacementâ€”repairs are less profitable.
2. **What draught-proofing system do you use?** Perimeter sealing (Ventrolla system or similar) is most effective.
3. **Can you source matching glass?** For listed buildings or discerning owners, period glass matters.
4. **What guarantee do you offer?** Expect 10-year minimum on timber repairs; lifetime on draught-proofing.
5. **Do you have conservation area experience?** References from listed buildings in Camden/Hampstead.

### Red Flags

Avoid contractors who:
- Immediately recommend replacement
- Are unfamiliar with slim double glazing options
- Cannot explain their draught-proofing system
- Have no conservation experience
- Quote without site survey

## Cost Comparison: Restoration vs. Replacement

For a typical Victorian sash window (1.2m Ã— 1.6m, 6-over-6 glazing pattern):

| Option | Cost | Lifespan | Quality |
|--------|------|----------|---------|
| Overhaul + draught-proof | Â£600 | 30+ years | Original retained |
| Full restoration + vacuum glazing | Â£1,800 | 50+ years | Original retained |
| Quality timber replacement | Â£2,500-3,500 | 25-40 years | Good reproduction |
| uPVC replacement | Â£800-1,200 | 15-25 years | Poor appearance |

For a house with 15 windows:
- Full restoration: Â£27,000
- Timber replacement: Â£45,000+
- uPVC replacement: Â£15,000 (but unlikely to receive planning consent in conservation area)

Restoration is not only the conservation choice but the economical choice.

## Maintenance Requirements

### Annual Maintenance

Restored windows require modest ongoing care:

**Every year**:
- Wipe dust and debris from sill and frame
- Check operation (sashes should slide freely)
- Lubricate pulleys (light oil)
- Touch up paint chips (prevent moisture entry)

**Every 3-5 years**:
- Wash down exterior paintwork
- Check draught seals (replace brush pile if worn)
- Inspect putty and replace where cracked

**Every 8-12 years**:
- Full external redecoration (strip if paint built up; spot-prep and repaint if sound)

### What to Avoid

- **Pressure washing**: Can force water into joints and behind putty
- **Aggressive stripping**: Heat guns near glass risk cracking; chemicals risk damage to glazing bars
- **Acrylic paints on exterior**: Less durable than oil-based gloss; encourage traditional finishes
- **Silicone sealants**: Temporary fix that prevents proper repair later

## Special Cases

### Georgian Windows (pre-1840)

Georgian windows have special considerations:

**Thinner glazing bars**: Often 15-18mm versus Victorian 25-30mm. Repairs require exceptional skill.

**Crown glass**: Original hand-blown glass has significant value. Preservation and careful relocation (when necessary) is essential.

**Early sash weights**: Cast lead (Georgian) rather than cast iron (Victorian). Valuable and should be retained.

**Six-over-six pattern**: The classic Georgian arrangement; should be maintained even if other sashes on the building have been altered.

Specialist restoration contractors with Georgian experience are essential.

### Victorian Picture Windows

Late Victorian houses often have large picture windows with marginal glazing:

**Large panes**: Difficult to source replacements in period glass. Consider slim double glazing to protect originals.

**Marginal lights**: Small coloured panes around central clear glass. Often damaged; specialist glass suppliers can match.

**Weights**: Very heavy (large panes = heavy sashes). Ensure cords and pulleys rated appropriately.

### Bay Windows

Bay windows present additional challenges:

**Geometry**: Angled or curved glass requires careful measurement.

**Access**: Internal scaffolding or towers often needed for restoration.

**Structural considerations**: Bay construction may need independent assessment if decay is extensive.

## Conclusion

The case for restoring original sash windows is overwhelming: superior authenticity, better long-term value, lower cost, and full compliance with conservation policy. Replacement is justified only in the rarest circumstancesâ€”and even then, it represents a permanent loss.

For Hampstead's Georgian and Victorian properties, original windows are often among the most significant surviving features. Their restoration should be approached with care, using specialists who understand both the historical value and the technical requirements.

If your windows seem beyond hope, get a second opinion from a restoration specialist before accepting replacement. What appears to be terminal decay is almost always repairable. The original windows have survived 150 years; with proper care, they will survive another 150.

The investment in restoration pays dividends: reduced energy bills, improved comfort, enhanced value, and the satisfaction of preserving craftsmanship that cannot be replicated. It is the responsible choice, the economical choice, andâ€”for those who appreciate the character of old buildingsâ€”the only choice that makes sense.
